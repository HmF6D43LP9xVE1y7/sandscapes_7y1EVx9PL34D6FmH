His/her talent         in giving the "natural intelligence" of the body a soul, sticks to him/her         like a blemish. His /her "aesthetic enigmatic character" (Theodor Adorno)         and the conspicuous absurdity of his/her actions place him/her in the         position of the outsider in a sphere that withdraws itself from social         monopolisation.</p>      <p class="font"> The irrationality of every artistic performance makes         a fool of our present -day pragmatism; our efficiency-obsessed way of         thinking. It contradicts the human desire to dominate the body. Instead,         the artiste ridicules the divide between the body and the whole person         because he/her has accepted the condition of the body. He/her sees the         body as it is, not how he/her would like it to be, because dressage, monotonous         training and stopwatch are not necessarily helpful in discovering new,         until now unfathomable bodily "resources".</p>      <p class="font"> To be able to fly with a ship...to juggle with singing         objects... to glide over a high-wire in stilettos... all this absurd "nonsense"         makes it clear for us that, inorder to compare, to capture, to hold onto         something, we should not petrify and become set in our ways. That is the         "dedication to abstinence", the need to know that we are safe. Our desire         to have a protected sphere is intimately connected with our fear of losing         it. Fear is the real motive behind our search for "security". Out of the         feeling of fear dogmas, authorities, and prejudices are built up, activities         are created, which prevent us from being true and courageous.</p>      <p class="font"> A single circus performance can however, by means         of poetic gestures and visual enhancement , give shape and form to some         of these human qualities: to experience oneself in the here and now, to         be harmonious, attentive and authentic, to imagine one's creative potential,         to get a feeling for what is real....</p>      <p class="b">Sky Sela</p>      <p align="center" class="text">I</p>      <p class="font">I exist. It is enough, at times. My hands are small,         and square. I wonder briefly, if they are cabable of transfering all of         the longing that I feel, onto this page. </span></p>      <p class="font">Shane lingers in corner of my eyes pride flood my         tongue and my teeths are clamped shut, holding back the deliscious word:         Clown.</span></p>      <p class="font"> I am a clown. So humilating, and so noble at the         same time. After sixteen years of trap?ze, I have finally let go of that         stin, dense bar that I gripped with such terrible determination. I would         fly.</span> </p>      <p align="center" class="text">II</p>      <p class="font">I knocked around violently, pretending to be free.            The wind was like silk. My arms were strong.</span>      </p>     <p class="font">But if I let go, it was for a split second, and the               fear was like an electric shock.

Too stubborn                 to listen to subtle signs, my body had to lead me to a total halt.

I fly in, in         a panic of insecurity. In a breathless flurry, gasping at the wastness         of my own freedom. <br>        Overwhelmed by the brutality of the task I set myself: total honesty.         <br>      I will be myself.
