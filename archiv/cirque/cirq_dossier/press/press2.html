Can it be put in more simple terms? Circus - pure and simple - this is the name of the company that has raised an aesthetic blue plastic tent by the entrance to F&aelig;lledparken, in connection with Copenhagen International Theatre's summer festival FOOLS 25. The name is not coincidental. Simple, but by no means poor, is Cirque's trademark. Purged of beatings around the bush, ornaments and indulgent effects the show presents the humanity behind the artistry that occupies the worn floorboards of the stage. Naturally the four performers are experts in their fields, with specially designed acts and skills. But the performers' intense presence on stage and their acting personalities are stronger still, and this creates the intimate dogma circus. Here, the performers stare right into the audiences' eyes and insist on addressing them across the edge of the stage beneath the confined canvas. Because everyone is as much an actor as an artist. And we become the audience on the first row. Trembling calves, breath withheld and an ecstatic sea-blue gaze, staring concentrated into nothingness: The tightrope walker is close-up, and so are the rest of the inhabitants of the stage. See the talcum powder spill off the toe-shoes, as they dance across the tense wire, notice the hard skin in the high-heeled sandals. Get dust in your eyes, see the sweat flow and feel the rush of a heaven-bound, circulating flying boat under the dome of the tent.<br>        <em>by Jakob Steen Olsen.

Her big-toe and its enlarged bunion grabs hungrily around the wire, and she undertakes a lonely duel with gravity. The muscles of her thigh move slightly, as her arm waves a velvet glove, like a fairy leaf, for balance. She is in a dream world of weightlessness.<br>              She becomes braver. Starts to jump on the wire - small jumps, bigger ones, wilder ones - until she does a split on the thin rope. And then she puts on toe-shoes and they too find their groove in grotesque ballet leaps.<br>              All the time she is smiling. An immensely delighted smile. For each successful step she becomes more ecstatic, and then she attempt the impossible: Placing a ladder on the wire - she climbs to the sky&hellip;<br>            Where else can you find happiness?</p>                    <p class="font"><strong>Two performing sisters</strong><br>              But is happiness really happiness at all? This is how Henry Miller's short story &quot;The smile at the foot of the ladder&quot; becomes twisted and turned in the wonderfully poetic circus adaptation by the French new circus Cirque by Trianglen, in Copenhagen. Full of beauty, gentility and wisdom - wearing the kind of smile-wrinkles around the eyes that can't be created by make-up. <br>              The performers are two sisters and their husbands: The tightrope walker Ayin de Sela - and her acrobat sister Sky. They illustrate Miller's story, from which they read extracts aloud, thrilled by the clown who wishes to give his audience &quot;eternal joy&quot;.<br>              Sky's husband, Mads Rosenbeck - &quot;you got it, I'm the Dane&quot; - juggles with carpets, clubs and sleeves, and the dream becomes visible on the outside of his coat. He hasn't performed in Denmark for 14 years, and amongst the audience was a longing welcoming committee.<br>              Mads Rosenbeck's talent is exquisite; he is an obvious choice for the film part of the library thief, because he can look so very learned and innocent in his gold-rimmed glasses - and yet he hides all sorts of things under his coat&hellip; And where Mads Rosenbeck's movements possess wildness, his musical brother-in-law, Sebastian Apert, owns a corresponding passion in his flamenco-fiery sounds. They are emitted from his creation, a cart full of water instruments and wobbly funnels and anything that can make a noise.<br>              Still the performance's transformation occurs when Sky sits on the floorboards and puts on some white clown make-up. It is an ancient circus act and this is plainly stated. And yet the trick works: As the clown appears in the woman, the dream appears too.<br>      The dream of achieving the impossible. Such as climbing a ladder to the sky. Right up into the sky.<br>      <em>by Anne Middelboe Christensen.Information fools 25-10.08.0</em></p>            <span class="b">Heading for the sky</span>            <p class="font"><strong>The small French company Cirque have created little pearls of joy from pure circus magic.<br>            </strong>How many feet does a clown have? And how far away is the sky? <br>              There are moments of bliss, where everyone levitates in this small circus tent by Trianglen. And then there's the difficulty of landing.<br>      This is the essence of this little pearl of joy performance, created by the French quartet company Cirque: About reaching for an ideal in the sky. Alternately the artists tell the story of a circus clown, who longs to be another clown, but realises that he needs to land in himself. </p>      <p class="font">It turns utterly magical when a small woman (Sky Sela) calmly sits down to paint her face white - and transformation occurs. Suddenly an irresistibly delighted clown appears, eyes blinking in wonder at how many feet emerge when hands and feet become one. Or ecstatic, due to a small underarm hair - imagine such a tiny, dear underarm hair!<br>              It becomes even more fascinating, because this clown buries her fingers deeply into the circus genre's primal soup: crossing physical perimeters, with monstrous bodies, that can twist beyond any normal human form, bordering on repulsive taboo areas. Like when the clown woman ecstatically bends the outmost joint of her fingers, so they turn into deformed claws, designed to hunt for earwax. <br>      Like when the performance's throbbing musical pulse, Sebastian Apert, on his rolling instrumentarium, consisting of drums, cymbals and whining strings presents Sky Sela, guiding us to the far corners of the senses. A wild, fantasising clown-being that also has landed in the familiar physicality of the body. Operation ascension accomplished. Forget about August and the classic white clown. This one is a wonderfully mutated new creation. Pure and simple clown nonsense. And the smiles at the foot of the ladder spread.<br>  <em>by Monna Dithmer.

He is a megalomaniac clown, they are three self-conscious acrobats and a quiet musician. But as the story is told, it transpires that the lives of Auguste and of the actors overlap seamlessly. So much so, in fact, that they wrong-foot the audience: are they performing their own circus tricks here, or are they playing the characters from the book? Judging by the opening scene, the former seems more likely. Tightrope walker Ayin astounds with her incredibly agile body. She is able to move graciously along a taut steel cable, even on stiletto heels. Doing the splits on the rope seems a mere bagatelle; only when she jumps a metre and a half into the air, from this extremely awkward position, does it get really exciting. And it is only when 'ringmaster' Sky starts reading the story of Auguste that it really becomes clear that Cirque is no ordinary circus performance. From this moment, all of the tricks fall into the context of the sad tale of Auguste, a clown who is stretched to breaking point by his quest for eternal happiness. This is revealed, for example, when, following a drastically un-successful performance, the clown is demoted to dogsbody. Suddenly, Cirque attendant Mads appears on stage. He can't decide whether to start sweeping the stage or juggling with some clubs that happen to be lying there. He eventually combines the two in a spectacular act that demands the admiration of the other actors. Is Mads being himself here, or Auguste? And what about Sky, who dresses up as a clown when the story reaches the point when Auguste deputises for the new clown Antoine, who has fallen ill? Why does tightrope walker Ayin get so angry when Sky and Mads derive a great deal of pleasure from their roles as clown and juggler? Because they are no longer interested in the story ('Antoine dies from a feeling of redundancy'), or because she feels excluded? The audience can decide for itself. Unpretentious enjoyment of the acrobatics and clowning is as possible as accompanying Cirque in the search for the deeper meaning of Miller&Otilde;s poetry ('the search for the self, your true being'). This freedom of choice, combined with the high level of the acrobatic stunts and exceptional music by Sebastian Apert on homemade instruments, makes The smile at the foot of the ladder an extremely strong production. (Arjen Bakker)<br>      <em>Friesch Dagblad 12 June 04</em></p>       <p class="font">In 1959&nbsp; the polish theatre giant Jerzy Grotowski, proclaimed for actors the future of "poor theatre". "Cirque", the next in the series of productions following the legendary "Cirque O" and world success "Que-Cir-Que", has now done the same with a poor circus. Three artistes: Ayin de Sela, Sky Sela and Mads Rosenbeck with the musician Sebastien Apert, show to us in reduced form the heart of circus: the dream of taking off from reality. They enchant the audience with the simplest of means. In opposition to this is Miller's text "The smile at the foot of the ladder" read by a different actor or actress each week. Among others: Dietmar Mues, Georgette Dee, Bernd Grawert, Ulrike Grote, Annelore Sarbach and Catrin Striebeck. Miller describes a clown who is desperately searching for himself. Sky Sela goes lives this process of searching and development with great intuition and melancholy. It is she who makes the dream of flying come true when she takes off for the circus sky in a tiny rowing boat. Images that make the poor circus a true circus.<br>      HAMBURG:Pur, august 2002</p> <br>     <span class="b">With ease the human being is enchanted, and then he thinks.</span>      <p class="font">The most&nbsp; beautiful things in life require us not to breath a word. Therefore : hush!, dear reader, don't tell anyone, the following is for your ears only. In the tent -theatre Fliegende Bauten a few enchanting artistes are performing a sort of circus that re-defines itself every evening. A man with a beautiful voice reads a story and, in between, three artistes and an artistic musician perform their tricks.The artistes do this with only a few props, the musician drums on a strange instument created by the brothers Baschet. His bass drum is the floor of the stage. <br>"The smile at the foot of the ladder" is the text. Henry Miller wrote it and it is quite philosophical. I think he wants to tell us that nothing is more precious than being oneself. And that revenge will be taken if one tries to hide oneself in someone else, because one is no longer able to cope with ones own life. Especially in the case of the famous Clown August. He wants to be the No Name clown Antoine inorder to be able to begin his career again. The other, Antoine in this case, has no other alternative ; he has to die. There is no place for oneself in anyone else. <br>        At the beginning a woman gets into an oldfashioned looking type of wooden flying boat with rudders and tries to pull herself, and the strange little ship, up on a rope. It doesn't work of course. Happens to us all! That our great strengths, as in the case of this Countess M&uuml;nchhausen, fail in the face of the simplest things. Sometimes the artists do things that seem to a reply to the text, more often they do something completely different. The text and the tricks play with each other. <br>        After a quarter of an hour one looks at one's watch and wonders why the performance is over. The watch says 11 o clock, it began at 9.30 , where did the time go? It disappeared in looking, listening, in enchantment... <br>        Go and see it, once every week, because the reader changes every week. By the way, at one point Countess M&uuml;nchhausen rows with her little boat into the air, right up to the top of the tent. Such a contraption would have been more useful for the little brownie instead of his bed. "More! More!" He sceamed. If you keep very quiet, you might hear him.<br>    <em>(TRS) DIE WELT</em></p>    </td>    <td width="105" background="../../cirq_frame/frame_right.gif">&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table></body></html>
