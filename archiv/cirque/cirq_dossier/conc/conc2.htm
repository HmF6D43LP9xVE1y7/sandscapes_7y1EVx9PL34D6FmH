Many artists from different disciplines have expressed this in their       works. Painters, musiciens, cineasts and architects... each of them did live their &quot;own&quot; circus. </span></p><p class="font">Their work lets us share their love for circus. Fascinated by the imagination provoked by them, we live through them our own circus.<p class="font">What is the circus itself beyond all its different interpreted forms? Is it possible to (re)discover it, not through the image we have of it, but through our own instantanious common experiences?<p><span class="b">Cirque</span> <p class="font">A   tent skin, the stage in the centre, in the round 350 spectators, a story, one   musician, one instrument, three circus artists and the elements of light -&nbsp; each part has it's own form. When the performance begins, together they become   the story itself....<p><span class="b">The Story</span>     <p class="font">Inspired by Henry Miller's short story <br>   The smile   at the foot of the ladder </span>      <p class="font">August is ambitious, successful and popular. He "wanted to endow his spectators with a joy which would prove imperisable" - but he fails. His attempts to find himself as someone else turn out to be impossible. <br> The consequences are tragic. Balancing precariously between self - deception and disappointment, lies and desperation,&nbsp; August realizes that, in order to be happy, he can only be himself - no one else. <br> August frees himself from the utopian idea that happiness can only be found somewhere else; in another person, under other circumstances, in another form. </span><p class="font">As we listen to, or read&nbsp; Henry Miller's story, we observe and absorb the story from the outside. </span> <p class="font">When the artists themselves tell the story, they speak from experience of the circus world ; They put into words their own art -&nbsp; acrobat, clown, juggler or high-wire artist. </span> <p class="font">Their words shed a new light on their work. The story itself&nbsp; becomes authentic and understandable for us. It reminds us of our own story and it stretches to become ours. Our view then shifts: from the outside to the insight.</span><p><span class="b">The Circus Artists</span><p class="font">"There   is nothing in the least illusory about these creations of his. Their reality is   imperishable." Henry Miller</span>   </span><p class="font">Their   work draws from a reservoir of "Non-Sense". Only this senseless physical self-evidence   reveals the "truth": they enter the stage with nothing but themselves; they are   self sufficient and so essentially contradict the accepted principles of order   because what they do is not "efficient": what use is it to walk a tightrope...?</span> <p class="font">....what nonsense, wanting to fly in a little ship - despite this SKY&nbsp; SELA lives out her dream, which is not a dream of escape. She wants to fly, she wants to sweep the depths, to touchthe ache that is joy. She wants to break through the roof ofthe tent&nbsp; with her ship to be part of this world, not to leave it behind, but to try her wings.</span><p class="font">...what sense does it make to high-heel over a metal   rope in an evening dress AYIN DE SELA is upheld by the wire that defines her movement.   What could that be other than perfect? How could the balance be anything but vital?</span> <p class="font">...is it the objects that move the people or do the people move the objects? MADS ROSENBECK looks at both himself and his objects with amazement. He follows the movement of his juggling clubs and his own movements simultaneously. What comes first, the clubs or the hands, or are they the same? Not a hero defying gravity. Only wonder, following agitation.</span> <p><span class="b">The Music</span> <p class="font">SEBASTIEN APERT composed original music with instruments invented by the Baschet brothers. With these sound sculptures the percussionist curves and tempts the sounds to perfection, by hitting, rubbing, scraping, like an echo from the beginning of time.</span>  <p><span class="b">The Circus Tent</span> <p class="font">The sail-makers were the first to build tents. Anchored by two poles our tent shelters 350 spectators from the rain , the wind and the sun. An ephemeral site, a fugitive hour. We're never sure if we're on board a ship cleaving through lost memories or if we're being gently propelled into the present.</span>  <p><span class="b">Cirque</span> <p class="font">Cirque - a meeting : literature, music,&nbsp; artists and audience in the circus. <br>A circus made up of artists, the &quot;travelling folk&quot; and the audience.This project is dedicated to the audience, without whom it could not, would not take place. The audience create the event. Without the audience the artists space cannot be discovered. Because of the authenticity of the artistic performance in the intimate round of the circus tent, audience and artist "touch each other". Their experience becomes one. It is as if they have recognized each other - those who live it and those who look for it ...</span></td><td width="105" background="../../cirq_frame/frame_right.gif">&nbsp;</td></tr></table></body></html>
