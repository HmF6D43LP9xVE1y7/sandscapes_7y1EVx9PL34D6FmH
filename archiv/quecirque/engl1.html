They are indeed walking the tightrope of artistic passions; eruptions of the subconscious desire to overcome dualistic circumstances. <P><P>The direction has been trimmed to the essentials, the props are simple; candles, a bicycle tube, a carpet, a trapeze, a broom, elastic ropes, a light bulb, a bicycle, a beer tap, a cigar, a tin of shoe polish, ballet slippers, a bicycle wheel and the dramatic axis.<P><P>The dialogue which is brought about by the interplay of objects and actors makes us believe that we are dealing with materialised soul rather than utility objects. The artist is transformed into a prop, the prop turns independant.<P> The motions don't serve desire for sensation, rather they direct our attention to the origins, to the very font of creativity, in a way which allows the spectator to experience playfulness and desire at close proximity.<P>&#147;The creative breath originates from a zone of man to which he can not descend, even if Virgil were to lead him, for not even Virgil would descend there.&#148;<I>Jean Cocteau. in: Diaries.</I>      </FONT>  </UL></UL> </TD></TR></TABLE>	</BODY></HTML>
